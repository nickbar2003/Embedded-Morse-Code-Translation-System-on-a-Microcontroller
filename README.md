# Embedded-Morse-Code-Translation-System-on-a-Microcontroller





Running list of videos I referenced to learn a new avr concept / borrow code. I am being very cautious and conservative when it comes to using someone elses code. I want to learn these concepts for myself, not just copy someone else. In all cases where I borrow a snippet of code, I am only really doing so temporarly when the concept is new to me, as I read the MCU documentation and it starts to click I can either reimplement from scratch, or explain in depth what each line of code that I borrowed is doing and how it gives the desired effect, or alter the borrowed snippet to serve my purpose in a more specific way, thus proving a practical level of understanding.

In my program I will try to add comments in places were I am using another persons code, but the intent here is to gain an in depth and independent understanding of these concepts. 

In one instance I temporarily used some elses code for USART config while I was first learning the protocol, yet after reading the documentation and really learning it for myself, I was able to reimplement it almost entirely from scratch, thus showing myself that I had gained independent proffiecny with the topic.
